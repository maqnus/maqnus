## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a designer that turned to development, currently focused on creating user friendly, and preferably beautiful UI using frontend tools like react, sanity, express, etc. 

My name is Magnus and I am currently employed as a senior software developer at âœ¨ [Gjensidige](http://gjensidige.no/) âœ¨, where we focus on safeguarding people's lives, health and assets.


Started working with traditional graphic design work in 2008, doing logo-work, defining brand guidelines and creating printed media for companies, events, musicians etc.
My focus has gradually shifted towards digital media, and since 2015 my main focus has been creating user centered design using frontend technologies.

The last years have gone to helping both state owned and privately owned companies build web-platforms using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](http://angular.io/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Highcharts](highcharts.com), [ChartJs](https://www.chartjs.org/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/), [Sanity](http://sanity.io/)
