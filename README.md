### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Magnus
ðŸ”­ I'm currently employed as a senior developer at âœ¨ [FundingPartner](http://fundingpartner.no/) âœ¨, a fintech startup at the [StartupLab](https://startuplab.no/) in Oslo, Norway.

I started working with traditional graphic design work in 2008, making logos, defining design guidelines and creating printed media for companies, events, musicians and etc.
My focus did gradually move towards digital media, and by 2013 I had shifted my focus towards user centered digital design, and since 2015 my focus has been on making user centered design work as intended using frontend technologies. The last years I have mostly been working with larger state owned or privately owned companies.
